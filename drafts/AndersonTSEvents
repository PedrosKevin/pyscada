Fall is coming upon the area, leaves are turning and temperatures are dropping, meaning fall is for real officially coming. Many fun events come from the fall change, including festivals, football games, and trick or treating! With fall coming into full swing, there are some fun festivals you can visit for a fall and Halloween thrill! There’s Burger Farms, Shaw Farms, and Kings Island, for your fall or Halloween thrill or pumpkin picking fun! The township had the big rival game this weekend, Anderson vs Turpin where Anderson was victorious! The town is filling with cool air, I hope that you won’t be scared. In news of a new restaurant, they're building something new next to Graeter's, what are your thoughts, I’ve heard rumors of Raising Cane's. Will Chick-fil-a still be great? Or what if it's something else? That's all that's going on in the town, and hopefully, you feel impressed, because our township is the best!
