Recognition Night for all of the fall athletes was Tuesday, October 16th. The seasons for football, tennis, cross country, golf, cheerleading, and volleyball have come to an end. The cross country guys landed themselves in 1st place in the ECC Championship and girls got themselves in 4th. The guys golf team had an undefeated season, with the first ever team league championship. The girls, with a group of mostly new athletes, also landed themselves high in the tournament. The girls tennis team had an overall score of 12 wins, 6 loses, and 1 tie! The silver volleyball team got themselves in 1st place and blue volleyball team got themselves in 4th! Great sports season overall, well deserved recognition night! With this season of sports ending make sure to start registering for winter sports!
